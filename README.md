# Why do we want to make NextWordApp?


Because in the more than ten years of my education, I have experienced many English learning software, all of which require my own self-motivation to learn.
So I often wonder if I can make a learning platform that suits my favorite learning style?
With the development of Ai and Web3, the ideal platform in my mind has gradually emerged from my heart: a language learning platform that can provide an interesting, customized, more fun to learn, and learning to earn money.
